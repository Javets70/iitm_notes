# Types of Models 

## Generative Model-Based Algorithm
For a dataset $D= \{ (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), ... (x_n,y_n) \}$,
let $x$ and $y$ both be binary features such that $x_i \in \{ 0,1 \}^d$
and $y_i \in \{ 0,1 \}$

> Can features be binary? Does it even have an real life uses?

> The features can be binary and usually represent Yes/No type 
question. One of the examples is of spam classification of mail 
which we will be doing now.
