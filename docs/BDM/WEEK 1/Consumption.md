# Consumption and Demand 

## Divisions of Economic Activity 
- **Production**: The making of goods is production.
- **Consumption**: The way a consumer uses the goods.
- **Exchange**: It is the exchange of goods and services in return of something with monetary value.
- **Distribution**: Distribution is not only of the goods produced but also the resources required to produce.
It works within exchange.
- **Investment**: Saving up money to invest in the future. For a consumer it might be saving up money for a house.
For a producer it can be investing in better machines or resources.

## Production
- Production is the process of converting raw materials into useful good/service.
Goods/services become useful as they acquire utility value in the process of 
production.

- Producers have limited capital resources while they have a wide range of goods
and services to choose from for their firms and factories to produce.

- With the given prices of inputs they choose such combinations which minimise cost of 
production so that they earn maximum profit.

!!! note 
    - The production data must be always upto date as the needs of the consumer 
    change with time.
    - Price determination mechanism also plays a major role in the process of production and
    consumption.


## Consumption 
- **Consumption** is that economic activity which is concerned with the use of goods and services
for the direct satisfaction of individuals and collective wants.

- A **consumer** is a person who consumes goods and services for the satisfaction 
of his/her wants. (Satisfaction may vary from person to person)

- Consumption activity is the base of all production activities.
(Goods which are not consumed by the consumer would not be produced.)

### Factors Affecting Consumption 
- As a consumer has limited income , while their wants are unlimited.

- Study of consumption behaviour is concerned with the question "How people use their given /
limited means for the purchase of different goods and services, so that satistfaction is maximized?"

- In consumption theory we formulate  a set of standard relationships explaining how customers 
tend to behave.

    !!! example
            Indians buying new clothes during the time of diwali.

## Exchange
- Exchange is that economic activity which is concenrned with the sale and purchase of commodities.

- In simple terms barter or buying and selling.


## Utility and Prices 
- When economists talk about consumer choice , what they are refering to
is the combination of goods and services a consumer purchases.

- To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look
at what consumers can afford , as shown in a **budget constraint** and the
**total utility** or satisfaction derived from those choices.

- **Utility** is the term economists use to describe satisfaction or 
happiness a person gets from consuming a good or service.
