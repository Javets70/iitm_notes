# Financial Analysis 
- Financial analysis of the firm helps in finding its own strengths and weaknesses
- Financial analysis helps in monitoring the key indicators of the firm

analysis)
- Financial Analysis helps in understanding a firmâ€™s past, present and future

??? question "What are Financial Statements?"
    - Financial statements are written records that convey the business activities and
    the financial performance of a company.
    - Balance sheet (annual financial record) (provides performance of company) ,
    income statement (sources of income) (sales, interests, etc), cash flow

## Ratio Analysis 
- Ratio analysis helps firms to evaluate performance, do structural analysis,
provide useful insights and relationship between various business activities and
performance
- Objectives of ratio analysis are to study efficiency of operations, study risk of
operations, compare performance with the past performance, compare
performance with other firms, evaluate current performance and etc

!!! info "Limitations of Ratio Analysis"
    - Accounting practices may differ from one firm to another
    - Seasonality affects ratio analysis, eg: one quarter saw huge increase in
    performance (via. ratios) because of more festivals in that quarter which is not
    the right indicative. In such cases along with that quarter you could compare it
    with Annual performance to make sense of it.

??? info "5 Major Ratios"
    - **Liquitdity**: the ability of a firm to pay its way 
    - **Investment/Shareholders** : Information to enable decisions to be made on the extent of the risk 
    and earning potential of a business investment.
    - **Gearing** : Information on the relationship between the exposure of the business to loans 
    as opposed to share capital.
    - **Profitability** : How effective the firm is at generating profits given sales 
    and or its capital assets.
    - **Financial** : The rate at which the company sells its stock and the efficiency 
    with which it uses its assets.

### Types of Ratio Analysis
#### Acid Test (Quick Ratio)
- Quick ratio = (current assets - stock inventory) / liabilities
- 1:1 is an ideal ratio to have
- 3:1 is a healthy ratio, and would mean that there exists lot current assets
compared to liabilities
- 0.5:1 is an unhealthy ratio, this would put lot of pressure on the firm

#### Current Ratio 
- Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
- Too high or too low current ratio could be problematic
- Too high would mean that there are too many current assets and mostly tied up
with unproductive assets
- Too low would mean the risk of not able to pay your way
- Ideal ratio is 1.5:1
- 5:1 ratio would mean Rs 5/- in assets is available to cover every Rs1/- of liabilities
- 0.75:1 ratio would mean 75p in assets is available to cover every Rs1/- of
liabilities

#### Ratios Used by Investors 
- **Earnings Per Share** : Profit after tax / number of shares
- **Price Earnings Ratio** : Market Price / Earning per share - The higher the better 
generally for company. Comparison with other firms helps to identify value placed 
on the market of business.
- **EV / EBITDA Ratio** : The higher the better for the company. It measures operational
performance of the firm.
- **Dividend Yield** : Ordinary share dividend / market price * 100 - the higher the better.
Related the return on the investment to share price.

#### Gearing Ratio 
- Gearing ratio =( long term loans/capital employed) * 100
- This ratio provides for an idea on how much capital is employed from the long
term loans taken

### Profitability 
Profitability measures look at how much profit the firm generates from sales 
or its capital assests.

#### Different Measures of Profit 
- **Gross Profit** : Effectively total revenue (turnover) - cost of goods sold

    !!! info "Gross Profit Margin"
        Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Turnover * 100

        - The higher the better 
        - Enables the firm to assess the impact of its sales and how much it cost to generate 
        those sales.
        - A gross profit margin of 45% means that for every 1$ the firm makes 0.45$ in gross profit.

- **Net Profit** : Effectively total revenue (turnover) - Variable costs and fixed costs (overheads)

    !!! info "Net Profit Margin"
        Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Turnover * 100

        - Net profit takes  into account the fixed costs involved in production - the overheads.
        - Keeping control over fixed costs is important - could be easy to overlook for example 
        the amount of waste - paper , stationery , lighting , heating , water ,etc.

- **ROCE** : Return on Captial Employment = Profit / Capital Employed * 100
    - The higher the better
    - Shows how effective the firm is in using its captial to generate profit
    - Partly a measure of efficiency and use of capital in an organisation.
    - A ROCE of 25% means that it uses 1$ of capital to generate 25p in profit.

#### Stock Turnover Ratio
- Stock piling up is a big problem in stock intensive industries such as textile,
cement etc
- Stock turnover ratio = cost of goods sold / stocks expressed as times per year
- Low stock turnover ratio would mean poor customer satisfaction of the goods
and people may not be interested in the goods
- This ratio indicates the rate at which company stocks are turned over

??? question "What is debtor days?"
    - Debtor days = (debtor/sales turnover)*365
    - How long it takes for the business to recover its debts
    - Shorter the debtor days, better for the firm"

!!! abstract "Summary of Financial Ratios"
    - Ratios help to:
        - Evaluate Performance 
        - Structure Analysis 
        - Show the connection between activities and performance.
    - Ratios adjust for differenct sizes.
