# Production Decisions 

??? info inline end "Extra Information"
    ???+ abstract "2 factors concerning production decisions"
        Production decisions are intertwined with price and quantity. Pricing is a function
        of cost and quantity produced.

## Production Function 
- It gives you the maximum level of output to be produced based on the various
inputs.
- The production function gives relationship between inputs used in the production
and the maximum output production with given period of time and with given
period of technology
- $Q = f(x_1, x_2, ….x_n)$ where $x_1, x_2, …..x_n$ are inputs used in the production. $Q$ is the
maximum level of output.

### Types of Production Function 
#### Short Run Production Function
- Consider a simple production function with 2 inputs: capital and labour $Q = f(X,Y);
Q: \text{Output}, X: \text{Labour}, Y: \text{capital}$

- A function which provides the maximum output produced for given inputs such
that **at least one** of the production inputs remains unchanged
- Usually for a short-term production function, capital remains unchanged
- Short-term production function is useful in understanding short-term production
goal for the firm

#### Long Run Production Function 
- Consider a simple production function with 2 inputs: capital and labour $Q = f(X,Y);
Q: \text{Output}, X: \text{Labour}, Y: \text{capital}$

- A function which provides the maximum output produced for given inputs such
that at firm is free to vary ALL the production inputs

!!! note "Terms Relating to Short-run analysis"
    - **Marginal Product**, **Average Product** and **Total Product** are the three terms
    important to short-run analysis
    - Marginal Product (MP) $= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta X}$
    - Average Product ($AP_x$) $= \frac{Q}{X}$

## Marginal Product and Average Product
- MP gives you the estimate of change of production output resulting from unit
change in a variable output
- For example, let’s say a organic farming company wants to hire a manager, MP
gives you how much additional production is achieved from this additional hire
- MP helps in production decision making as stated in above example, should I hire
an additional person or not
- AP, for example gives you on and average what is total quantity of cement
produced by 1 person applicable to a cement manufacturing firm

??? question "How does a firm decide how much to produce and when/where to stop hiring?"
    For a firm it is utmost important to locate the level of its production, this can be
    done with the help of production data (MP, TP, AP)
