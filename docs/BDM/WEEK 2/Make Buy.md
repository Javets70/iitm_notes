# Make vs. Buy
## What is a make or buy decision for a firm?
??? note inline end "Sunk Costs"
    A firm entering into an agreement with a marketing agency and need to pay the
    fee upfront is termed as sunk cost. Here during the course, let's say you do-not
    yield any results from this and thereby the cost of the fee is sunk (in metaphorical
    sense)

- This is a situation for the firm when it has to decide whether to buy from other
source (outsource) and sell (avoids investing in capital) or make it on its own via
investing in additional capital that is incurred to do so.
- **Sunk cost** also is one of the important factor in make or buy decision for a firm.

    !!! example 
        'Bata' decided it is better to outsource its operations of footwear
        making to several local firms than to produce it on its own. One such model could
        be it gives specifications of the models to be produced along with the quantity
        and Bata brands the foot wear with its logo and sells to the customers.So for
        Bata buy was the decision over make.

??? info "Firm Controlling the Market"
    A firm has control of price to fix on the commodity  or quantity to produce or both.

    - In a monopoly market, a firm can control both price and quantity
    - In a competitive markets, only quantity can be controlled
