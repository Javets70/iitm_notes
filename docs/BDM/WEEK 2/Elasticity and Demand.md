# The Elasticity of Demand 
Elasticity is the measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded or 
quantity supplied to a change in one of its determinants.

## Price Elasticity of Demand 
How much much the quantity demanded of a good reponds to a change in 
that price of that good.

It is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in price. Only the absolute value of the result is taken into consideration.

## Types of Elastic Demands
- **Elastic Demand** : It is when quantity demanded responds subtantially
to changes in price.

- **Inelastic Demand** : It is when quantity demanded responds only slightly
to changes in price.

### Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
- **Availability of close substitutes** : Goods with close substitutes have
more elastic demand.

- **Necessities vs. Luxuries** : Necessities have inelastic demand and Luxuries have
elastic demand.

    !!! example
        Buying a medicine no matter how costly it is for a family member is a necessity.
        During the 2nd covid wave , even when the price of oxygen cylinders was sky high ,
        people still bought them as it was a necessity for their loved ones.

        Luxuries like eating out have elastic demand because , if our favorite resturaunt 
        suddenly increases prices of all their food , we will most likely look for an alternate
        option which offers a better price.

### Types of Demand Curves
- **When Price elasticity of demand > 1** : It is said that Demand is elastic.
- **When Price elasticity of demand < 1** : It is said that Demand is inelastic.
- **When Price elasticity of demand = 1** : It is said that Demand has unit elasticity.
- **When Price elasticity of demand = 0**: The demand curve formed is vertical 
and Demand is said to be perfectly inelastic.
- **When Price elasticity of demand = infinity**: The demand curve formed is horizontal
and Demand is said to be perfectly elastic.
