# The Cost of Production

??? info inline end "2 Broad Agents of Market"
    - **Consumer** : Who demands via consumption. Objective of a consumer is to maximize his/her utility.
    - **Producer** : Who supplies via production. Objective of a producer is to maximize his/her profits.
    
The important factor that affect 'Supply' is 'Cost of Production

Based on the cost of production, several supply decisions can be arrived at like what goods to
produce ,  how much goods to produce  , to which segment to pitch the product to, etc.

## Types of Costs 
### Historical Cost and Replacement Cost 
- **Historical Cost** : It is the actual cost when purchasing an asset.

    !!! example 
        - Cost of Machinery while setting up a plant.
        - Purchasing land for setting up a factory.

- **Replacement Cost** : The price that is needed to replace a certain asset based on
the current market price, let's say Rs. 1 Cr

    !!! example 
        The cost of machinery today replacing the outdated one(which was
        purchased and put at time of setting up of the plant) at current market price let's
        say 2 Cr

        ??? question "What is a Depreciation Reserve?"
            A firm bought machinery for a cost of 5 Cr, after 15 years the exact machinery
            needs to be replaced by a new one. But the cost of the same machinery today 15
            years later is 15 Cr. To compensate this a firm starts a depreciation reserve,
            which accommodates a certain specific amount into this reserve, let's say 1 Cr
            per year and after 15 years, new machinery is bought from this reserve without
            any additional burden on the firm

### Fixed Cost and Variable Cost 
- **Fixed Cost** : All costs incurred that are unaffected by the company's production output
or sales.

    !!! example 
        - Interest to be paid to bank is independent of firm's sales being up or down
        - Rent to be paid is independent on firm's sales

- **Variable Cost**: All the costs that are associated with the firm that increase or
decrease with respect to the production volume/output. Those costs which
increase with increase in production volume and decrease with decrease in
production volume.

    !!! example 
        Cost of trolley autos increases with increase in production volume

### Real Cost and Prime Cost 
 - **Real Cost** : It accounts for physical quantities of various non-monetary factors
that are in materialistic terms. 

    !!! example
        Cost of number of nails, cost of cubic per feet and etc

- **Prime Cost**: It is the direct cost incurred in terms of material and labour involved
in the production excluding fixed cost. Prime costs help determine the selling
cost of a commodity to earn profit.
